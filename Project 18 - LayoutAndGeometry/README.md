  <h1>Project 18: Layout and Geometry</h1>
  <h3>Explore the inner workings of SwiftUI's layout system.</h3>
</div>

## Topics
 - How layout works in SwiftUI
 - Alignment and alignment guides
 - How to create a custom alignment guide
 - Absolute positioning for SwiftUI views

##  Challenges
1. Make views near the top of the scroll view fade out to 0 opacity â€“ I would suggest starting at about 200 points from the top.
2. Make views adjust their scale depending on their vertical position, with views near the bottom being large and views near the top being small. I would suggest going no smaller than 50% of the regular size.
3. For a real challenge make the views change color as you scroll. For the best effect, you should create colors using the Color(hue:saturation:brightness:) initializer, feeding in varying values for the hue.

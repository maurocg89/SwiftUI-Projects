  <h1>Project 15: Accessibility</h1>
  <h3>Learn how to make your apps available to everyone</h3>

## Topics
 - Identifying views with useful labels
 - Hiding and grouping accessibility data
 - Handling voice input in SwiftUI

##  Challenges
1. The check out view in Cupcake Corner uses an image and loading spinner that don’t add anything to the UI, so find a way to make the screenreader not read them out.
2. Fix the list rows in iExpense so they read out the name and value in one single VoiceOver label, and their type in a hint.
3. Do a full accessibility review of Moonshot – what changes do you need to make so that it’s fully accessible?

## Topics

implicit animations, explicit animations, binding animations, multiple animations, gesture animations, transitions, and more

##  Challenges

1. When you tap a flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis.
2. Make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity.
3. Add a third effect of your choosing to the two flags the user didn’t choose – maybe make them scale down? Or flip in a different direction? Experiment!

  <h1>Project 1: WeSplit</h1>
  <h3>Learn the basics of SwiftUI with your first project</h3>
</div>

## Topics
 - Form 
 - Section
 - NavigationView
 - @State
 - @FocusState
 - TextField 
 - Picker 
 - ForEach

## Challenges

1. Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
3. Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%. Tip: use the range `0..<101` for your range rather than a fixed array.

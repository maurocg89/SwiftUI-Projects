##  Challenges
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully understand whatâ€™s going on.

1. Try making the Slider and Change Filter buttons disabled if there is no image selected.
2. Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
3. Explore the range of available Core Image filters, and add any three of your choosing to the app.

  <h1>Project 5: Word Scramble</h1>
  <h3>Build a letter rearranging game with List</h3>
  <br/>
</div>

## Topics

List, onAppear, Bundle, fatalError(), UITextChecker

##  Challenges

1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
2. Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
3. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the playerâ€™s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.

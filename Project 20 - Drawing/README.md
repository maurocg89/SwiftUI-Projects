  <h1>Project 20: Drawing</h1>
  <h3>Use shapes, paths, colors, and more to create custom art for your app.</h3>
</div>

## Topics
 - Creating custom paths with SwiftUI
 - Paths vs shapes in SwiftUI
 - Adding strokeBorder() support with InsettableShape
 - CGAffineTransform
 - ImagePaint
 - Enabling high-performance Metal (framework) rendering with drawingGroup()
 - Special effects: blurs, blending, and more
 - Animating shapes with animatableData
 - Animating complex shapes with AnimatablePair
 - Creating a Spirograph

##  Challenges
1. Create an Arrow shape â€“ having it point straight up is fine. This could be a rectangle/triangle-style arrow, or perhaps three lines, or maybe something else depending on what kind of arrow you want to draw.
2. Make the line thickness of your Arrow shape animatable.
3. Create a ColorCyclingRectangle shape that is the rectangular cousin of ColorCyclingCircle, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using one or more properties.

<div align="center">
  <h1>Project 7: iExpense</h1>
  <h3>Bring in a second view with this expense tracking app</h3>
  <br/>
</div>

## Topics

UserDefaults, @AppStorage, Codable, sheet(), onDelete(), @StateObject, @ObservedObject, @Published

##  Challenges

1. Use the user’s preferred currency, rather than always using US dollars.
2. Modify the expense amounts in ContentView to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100 another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you.
3. For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expenses list into two sections: one for personal expenses, and one for business expenses. This is tricky for a few reasons, not least because it means being careful about how items are deleted!

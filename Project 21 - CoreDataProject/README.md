  <h1>Project 21: Core Data</h1>
  <h3>Take an in-depth tour of how SwiftUI and Core Data work together.</h3>
</div>

## Topics
 - Why does \.self work for ForEach?
 - Creating NSManagedObject subclasses
 - Conditional saving of NSManagedObjectContext
 - Ensuring Core Data objects are unique using constraints
 - Filtering @FetchRequest using NSPredicate
 - Dynamically filtering @FetchRequest with SwiftUI
 - One-to-many relationships with Core Data and @FetchRequest

##  Challenges
1. Make it accept a string parameter that controls which predicate is applied. You can use Swiftâ€™s string interpolation to place this in the predicate.
2. Modify the predicate string parameter to be an enum such as .beginsWith, then make that enum get resolved to a string inside the initializer.
3. Make FilteredList accept an array of SortDescriptor objects to get used in its fetch request.

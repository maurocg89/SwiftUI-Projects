  <h1>Project 14: Bucket List</h1>
  <h3>Embed maps and make network calls in this life goals app</h3>
</div>

## Topics

 - Comparable
 - FileManager
 - Secure Data writing
 - Switching view states with enums
 - MapKit
 - Touch ID and Face ID
 - MVVM

##  Challenges
1. Allow the user to switch map modes, between the standard mode and hybrid.
2. Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication, so add code to show those errors in an alert.
3. Create another view model, this time for EditView. What you put in the view model is down to you, but I would recommend leaving dismiss and onSave in the view itself – the former uses the environment, which can only be read by the view, and the latter doesn’t really add anything when moved into the model.

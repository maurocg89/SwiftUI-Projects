  <h1>Project 19: SnowSeeker</h1>
  <h3>Build an app for ski resorts that works great on iPad.</h3>
</div>

## Topics

 - Working with two side by side views in SwiftUI
 - Using alert() and sheet() with optionals
 - Using groups as transparent layout containers
 - Making a SwiftUI view searchable
 - Formatting lists in text
 - @Environment(dynamicTypeSize)
 - @Environment(horizontalSizeClass)

##  Challenges
1. Add a photo credit over the ResortView image. The data is already loaded from the JSON for this purpose, so you just need to make it look good in the UI.
2. Fill in the loading and saving methods for Favorites.
3. For a real challenge, let the user sort the resorts in ContentView either using the default order, alphabetical order, or country order.
